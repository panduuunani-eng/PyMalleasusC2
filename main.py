# Updated implementation

# Previously, a full filesystem scan was performed, which caused hanging issues.
# Now, we implement targeted analysis based on specific parameters.

def targeted_analysis(directory, parameters):
    # Implement the targeted analysis logic here
    pass

# Replace the hanging function with the targeted analysis

if __name__ == '__main__':
    directory = 'path/to_directory'
    parameters = {'key': 'value'}  # Define your parameters here
    targeted_analysis(directory, parameters)
